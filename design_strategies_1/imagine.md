# Exercise 1

# Apply the imagine how to use it strategy for this brief:
# As a student, so that I can remember people's names I want an IRB application that stores the names of people I meet.

# Don't implement the solution — just imagine how to use it.
# You will know it's right by reading the brief back and checking that your imagined solution satisfies it.

> save_name("Nathan")
=> "'Nathan' saved!"
> show_names
=> ["Nathan"]
> save_name("Sarah")
=> "'Sarah' saved!"
> show_names
=> ["Nathan", "Sarah"]

# As a student, so that I can understand my recent motivation I want an IRB application that stores my motivation ratings and, I want to see the average of my last 3 ratings

# Don't implement the solution — just imagine how to use it.

# You will know it's right by reading the brief back and checking that your imagined solution satisfies it.
